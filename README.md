# Smarchitect
//1
//Data Format
The format of the data regarding the house plan will be created by the group. A new format will be designed based upon the needs of the project and will be manipulated for 2D generation accordingly.


//2
//Dataset gathering and Normalizing/Feeding to Model 
1. Data can be collected in the form of Autocad models, and tranformed into the desired format. Need to explore possible libraries to automate process or we can map it manually
2. Data can be collected in form of 2D images, mapping will be done manually

Both 1 and 2 will be implemented with the tweaking module, as the dataset for the model will be according to our preferences


//3
//2D floor plan generation
1. Unity, strong grip on the working of it aswell as abundance of tools avaiable. will nuffily use of autocad in project.
2. Pyautocad, can be used to generate an Autocad model out of the floor plan produced by model.

//4
//Web module
1. If pyautocad, some tools are available for converting DWG to web compatible formats for user display
2. Canvas.js, prior experinece in javascript.

//5
//3D conversion
1. Unity is compatible with autocad, allowes to convert autocad model to 3D strucutres.
2. If Unity is used for 2D floor plan, then model can also be converted to 3D easily
